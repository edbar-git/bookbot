# Bookbot
A simple Python script that reads a `.txt` file stored in `/books` and prints it to the screen. At the end of the output a report of words and alphabetic characters count is also printed. Does not support loading different text files wihtout altering the `main.py` file. 

To run it, simply execute the `main.py` file in a Python environment.
